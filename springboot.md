# Programming lang vs Technology vs Framework

## Q) What is a programming language ?

        a) programming lang contains set of instructions 
        ex: C, C++, Java, C#
        b) Every programming language will follow set of syntaxes
        c) using programming language We can develop 
                applications/toos/software/technologies/Framework
        d) we can develop only stand alone applications                 


## Q) What is Technology?

        a) Technology is a software which is developed by using programming language
                ex: srvlets, JSP, JDBC
        b) Technologies are used to resolve common problems/ address common requirements/to simplify our tasks
        c) By using technologies we can develop our applications    


## Q) What is Framework?

        a) Framework is a semi developed software
        b) It provides common logics required for application development
                ex:
                        1) Capture form data
                        2) Validate form data
                        3) Create connection pool
                        4) DB CRUD etc.....

        c) It provides re-usable components
        d) For ex, every Java Developer should write below lines of code to perform DB operation

                Class.forName("");
                DM.getConn("");
                createStatement()
                executeQuerry()
                process ResultSet()
                close connection


### NOTE - If we are writing same code for multiple times then it is called a boiler plate code / redundant code.


        e) To avoid duplicate code/ common logic implementation, Frameworks came into picture.

                Project = Business Logics + Common Logics

        f) Frameworks provides common logics required for the projects so that we only have to focus on only business Logic development
        g) It will improve developers productivity, can do more work in less time

                ex: 
                JAVA=> Hibernate, Spring, Struts, Spring Boot
                .Net=> WCF
                Python=>  DJango, Flask
                Salesforce=> Lightning etc......


### NOTE - Frameworks will be developed by using Programming Language only.

## Tools :

        a) Tools are used to automate manual work
        
                Ex: 
                        1) Maven
                        2) JIRA
                        3) JENKINS
                        4) JMETER
                        5) POSTMAN
                        6) SONARQUBE etc....

# Architecture Types 
## 1) Monolith Architecture 
        a) developing all requirements as one application
        b) outdated, bcz maintenance will be difficult
        c) even for small changes baar baar poora project deploy krna pdega
        d) ek functionality me change krenge to baaki functons pr bhi effect hoga
## 2) Microservices Architecure
        a) divide and conquer
        b) divide the project into diff-diff parts 
        c) maintenance will be very easy
        d) loosely coupled APIs
        e) easy deployment 
        f) no single point of failure

## Types of frameworks 
### 1) Frontend Framework : 
                to develop user interface in the project
                ex: Angular
### 2) Web Frameworks :
                to develop web layer in the project 
                ex: Struts(Outdated)
### 3) ORM Frameworks : 
                to develop persistance layer in the project 
                ex: Hibernate 

## Struts Framework Disadvantages :                

                a) By using Struts we can develop only Web Layer in the project (Controllers)
                b) By using hibernate we can develop only Data Access Layer (Persistence Layer)

## Notes : To overcome the problems of Struts framework, Spring Framework came into market.

## Spring Framework :

                a) Spring Framework is called as Application Development Framework
                b) By using Spring Framework we can develop end to end application
                c) Spring is free & open source framework
                d) Spring framework is developed in Modular fashion
                e) Spring framework means collection of modules

## Spring Modules :

                1) Spring core
                2) Spring context
                3) Spring JDBC
                4) Spring ORM
                5) Spring AOP
                6) Spring Web MVC
                7) Spring security
                8) Spring social
                9) Spring Batch
                10) Spring Data JPA
                11) Spring REST
                12) Spring Cloud

### NOTE : Spring is a very flexible framework. It will not force to use all modules. We can choose based on our requirements.

                a) Spring is a versatile framework(Easily it can be integrated with other frameworks)
                b) The current version of Spring Framework 7.0
                c) Spring framework is under license of VM ware

## 1) Spring core : It is base module in the spring framework
=> Spring core module providing fundamental concepts of spring framework 

                1) IOC container(Inversion of Control)
                2) Dependency Injection
                3) Bean life cycle
                4) Bean Scopes
                5) Autowiring...   

## 2) Spring Context : It will deal with configurations reequired for our spring application

## 3) Spring AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming 
=> AOP is used to seperate business logic & secondary logics in the project     

                ex: Security, Logging, Tc, Auditing, Exception handling...

### NOTE : If we combine business logic and secondary logic together then we'll face maintenance issues  

## 4) Spring JDBC : Spring JDBC is used to simplify Database communication logic
=> Using Spring JDBC we can directly execute the querry, we dont have to write all the other connections like we do in java JDBC

## 5) Spring Web MVC : It is used to develop both Web application & Distribuited Application

                => Web Application (Customer to Business)
                        ex: Gmail.com, Facebook.com etc
                => Distribuited Applications (Business to Business) / Web Services (or) RESTful Services
                        ex: IRCTC, MakeMyTrip   

## 6) Spring ORM(Object Relation Manager)
=> Spring Framework Having Integration with ORM Frameworks
                ex: Spring ORM, Spring Data JPA etccc..

### NOTE : JDBC will represent data in text format whereas Hibernate ORM will represent data in objects format.

## 7) Spring Security : 

                a) Security is very cruicial for every application
                b) USing spring security We can implement Authentication & Authorization
                c) Spring security with OAuth2.0
                d) Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## 8) Spring Batch : Batch means bulk operation 

                a) Reading data from excel file and store it into database table
                b) Sending Monthly Statements to customers in email
                c) Sending reminder to customers as Bulk SMS

## 9) Spring cloud : It Provides some common tools to quickly build distribuited systems.    

                a) Provides service register to register microservices
                b) Provides Load balancer to balance the load of our application
                c) Provides Monitoring Facility
                d) PRovides API gateway to have single entry point for all our APIs
                e) Provides Circuit Breaker(Fault tolerant Systems)
                f) Distribuited Messaging 
                g) Routing

## 10) Spring Test : It provides Unit Test framework  

# Spring core

                a) Spring core module is all about managing dependencies among the classes with loosely coupling
                b) In project we will develop several classes. All those classes we can categorize into 3 types -
                        1) POJO
                        2) Java Bean
                        3) Component

## Q) What is POJO? (Plain Old Java Object)
=> Any Java class which can be compiled by using only JDK software is called a POJO class   

                ex1: Below class is a valid pojo
                class Demo{
                        int id;
                        String name;
                }

                ex2:
                class Demo2 extends Thread{
                        int id;
                        String name;
                }

                ex3:
                class Demo3 implememts Runnable{
                        // run method 
                } 
                ex4: not POJO
                class Demon4 implememnts Servlet{ (//part of JEE)
                        //run method
                }

## Q) What is Java Bean ?
 => Any Java class which follows bean specification rules is called as Java beans.

                1) CLass should implememnt serializable interface
                2) Class should have private data members(variables)
                3) Every private should have public getter and setter method
                4) Class should have zero-param constructor

### NOTE : Bean classes are used to write business logic and to store and retrieve data.

## Q) What is component?
=> The java class which contains business logic is called as component class.

                ex: Controllers, Service, DAO classes
                => Controller classes will have logic to deal with Request & Response
                => Service class will have business logic 
                        ex: Generate OTP ,Send OTP, Send Email, Encrypt & DEcrypt Passwords etc
                => DAO Clasees will contain the logic to communicate with database  

---
=> In a project we will develop multiple classes and those classes will be dependent on other classes.

        ex: 
                a) Controller class will call service class methods
                b) Service class will call DAO class methods

=> In java one class can talk to another class in two ways

                1) Inheritance (IS-A) [when we extend the class to use a method]  
                        [not recommended bcz we cant extend another classes as in inheritance the classes are tightly coupled and if we change a method in one class it might effect the another thats why they are tightly coupled]      
                2) Composition (HAS-A) [when we create the object for using the method] 
                        [not recommended bcz if they change the constructor of the engine class it will fail during compilation] 
                        
                        like before it was Engine() and we changed the constructors to Engine(break, fuel)

                        so if we have created 
                        Engine eng = new Engine();
                        (it'll fail)

                        
### Always we need to develop our classes with loosely coupling
- loosely coupling means without creating object and without inheriting properties we should be able to access one class methods in another class.
- If we make any changes in engine class then Car class should not be effected then we can say our classes are loosely coupled.

### To develop classes with loosely coupling we need to use INTERFACE

#### -> Note - A NullPointerException is a runtime exception that occurs when a program attempts to access or invoke a method, field, or operation on an object reference that is null. It is one of the most common exceptions in Java.

        ex: 
        public class Car{
                private IEngine eng; //IEngine is a interface and we are taking it as reference variable

                public Car(IEngine eng){ //created constructor so that who ever wants can initialise their own type of engine.
                        this.eng = eng;
                }

                public void drive(){ // in order to use the drive method it is the the instance method and to use the instance we have to create the object of car
                        int start = eng.start(); //null pointer exception so we'have created a constructor

                        if(start>= 1){
                                sout("journey started..");
                        }else{
                                sout("engine in trouble");
                        }
                }
        }

## Q) What is Dependency Injection?
- The process of injecting one class object into another class is call as "Dependency Injection"
- Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the objects that a class needs (dependencies) are provided from outside instead of the class creating them itself.
In Spring, the **Spring Container** creates and injects these dependencies automatically.
- We can perform DI in 3 ways -

        1) Setter Injection - write the setter method for the variable(private IEngine eng;)
        - Setter injection means , Injecting dependent object in target object using the class setter method

                //Setter
                public void setEng(IEngine eng){
                        this.eng = eng;
                }

                // how to call in main class
                Car car = new Car() //using the zero-param constructor to make the object of the class bcz we cannot perform the setter injection without creating the object of the car class
                car.setEng(new PetrolEngine());

        2) Constructor Injection - write the constructor for the class and give the object on which our class is dependent inside the parameter
        - Injecting dependent object into target object using target class constructor

                //Constructor
                public Car(IEngine eng){
                        this.eng = eng;
                } 

                //how to call in main class
                Car car = new Car(new DieselEngine());

### NOTE - If we use both setter and constructor injection together so first the CI will initialize the value and then the SI will again initialize it therefore "the setter Injection will @Override the constructor Injection"

        3) Field Injection - Injecting dependent object into target class using target class variable is call as Field Injection
        - To perform Field Injection we are using Reflection API 

                public class Car{
                        private IEngine eng; //we can only use private methods inside the class and not outside of it

                        public void drive(){
                                //code
                        }
                }


                NOTE - WE CAN ACCESS PRIVATE VARIABLE OUTSIDE OF CLASS USING REFLECTION API LIKE BELOW

                //in main class
                publiv class Main{
                        public static void main(String[] args) throws exception{
                                Class<?> clz = Class.forName("packqage.Car") //loading the class

                                Field engField = clz.getDeclaredField("eng"); //load the field whose name is "eng"(field object)
                                engField.setAccessible(true);(can be used even outside the class now)

                                Object object = clz.newInstance(); //whatever the class we have loaded we are creating the object for that class

                                Car carObje = (Car) object; //whatever obj we have created using neInstance() method we are type-casting that into Car class object

                                engField.set(carObj, new DieselEngine()); //Injecting value to variable

                                carObje.drive()
                        }
                }

## Q) IOC Container 
- Inversion of control
- IOC is responsible for Dependency Injection in Spring Application
- Dependency Injection means creating and injecting dependent bean objects into target bean classes.
- We need to provide "Java classes + Beans Confirguration" as input for IOC then IOC will perform DI and provides spring beans which are ready to use
### NOTE - IOC Container will manage life cycle of Spring Beans

## Q) What is Spring Bean?
- Any java class whose life cycle(creation to destruction) is managed by IOC Container is called as Spring Bean.
- We can represent Java Class as Spring Bean in 2 ways

        1) XML Approach (Outdated) (Springboot doesn't support XML approach but spring supports both)
                ex: <bean id = "id1" class = "pkg.ClassName" />
        2) Annotation Approch (Recommended)
                ex: @Component, @Service, @Repository etc...

## Q) How to start IOC in spring?
1) BeanFactory (outdated)
2) ApplicationContext(recommended)

                ex: ApplicationContext contex = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(String configFile);

### NOTE - Bean Configuration file contains bean definition
- Bean definitions - target class, dependent class, dependency Injection type

### NOTE - When IOC Container started it will read bean definitions from Bean configuration File and it will perform Dependency Injection 

# First Application Development using spring core module
- Pre-requesites : JDK 1.8v, STS IDE
1) Create Maven project in IDE
2) Add spring Core Dependency in pom.xml file (www.mvnrepository.com)
3) Create Required Java Classes
4) Create Bean Configuration File and configure Bean Definitions
5) Create Main class and start IOC Container to test the application.

# SHORT NOTES 1

# Spring Core - Short Notes

## 1. What is Spring Bean?

### Definition
A Spring Bean is an object created, managed, and maintained by the Spring IoC Container.

### Key Points
- Normal Java object (POJO).
- Created by Spring, not manually using `new`.
- Lifecycle managed by Spring.
- Used for Dependency Injection (DI).

### Example
```java
@Component
public class StudentService {
}
```

`StudentService` becomes a Spring Bean.

---

## 2. How to Represent a Java Class as a Spring Bean

### Using Stereotype Annotations
```java
@Component
public class StudentService {
}
```

Other common annotations:
- `@Component` → Generic Bean
- `@Service` → Business Logic Layer
- `@Repository` → Persistence Layer
- `@Controller` / `@RestController` → Web Layer

### Using @Bean Annotation
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public StudentService studentService() {
        return new StudentService();
    }
}
```

### Important Points
- Spring scans classes and registers them as Beans.
- Bean names are unique within the container.

---

## 3. What is IoC (Inversion of Control) Container?

### Definition
IoC Container is the core component of Spring that creates, manages, and injects Spring Beans.

### Responsibilities
- Creates Beans
- Stores Beans
- Injects Dependencies
- Manages Bean Lifecycle

### Real-Life Analogy
Without Spring:
```java
StudentService service = new StudentService();
```

With Spring:
```java
@Autowired
private StudentService service;
```

Spring creates and provides the object.

### Types
1. BeanFactory
2. ApplicationContext (Most commonly used)

---

## 4. What is Bean Configuration File?

### Definition
A configuration file tells Spring:
- Which Beans to create
- How Beans are connected
- Bean properties and dependencies

### XML Configuration Example
```xml
<bean id="studentService"
      class="com.example.StudentService"/>
```

### Java Configuration Example
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public StudentService studentService() {
        return new StudentService();
    }
}
```

### Modern Spring Boot
Mostly uses:
- Annotations
- Auto Configuration
- Component Scanning

XML is rarely used.

---

## 5. How to Start IoC Container

### Using ApplicationContext

```java
ApplicationContext context =
        new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
```

### Get Bean

```java
StudentService service =
        context.getBean(StudentService.class);
```

### Spring Boot

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

`SpringApplication.run()` starts the IoC Container.

### Important Point
- Container starts first.
- Beans are created and registered.
- Application becomes ready to serve requests.

## 6. First Application Development Using Spring Core Module

### Steps

#### Step 1: Create POJO

```java
public class Student {

    public void study() {
        System.out.println("Studying...");
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure Bean

```xml
<bean id="student"
      class="com.example.Student"/>
```

#### Step 3: Start Container

```java
ApplicationContext context =
        new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
```

#### Step 4: Get Bean

```java
Student student =
        context.getBean(Student.class);
```

#### Step 5: Use Bean

```java
student.study();
```

### Flow

Application Start
→ IoC Container Starts
→ Bean Created
→ Bean Stored
→ Bean Retrieved
→ Business Method Called

# Interview Revision Sheet

### Q1. What is a Spring Bean?
A Java object managed by the Spring IoC Container.

### Q2. What is IoC?
Control of object creation is transferred from the programmer to Spring.

### Q3. What is Dependency Injection?
Spring injects required dependencies automatically.

### Q4. Difference Between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
- BeanFactory → Basic container
- ApplicationContext → Advanced container (recommended)

### Q5. Which method starts Spring Boot?
```java
SpringApplication.run();
```

### Q6. Which annotation creates a Bean?
- `@Component`
- `@Service`
- `@Repository`
- `@Controller`
- `@Bean`

# Quick Revision (1 Minute)

- Bean = Object managed by Spring.
- IoC Container = Creates and manages Beans.
- Dependency Injection = Spring provides required objects.
- ApplicationContext = Popular IoC Container.
- Bean Configuration = Defines Bean creation.
- Spring Boot starts IoC using `SpringApplication.run()`.
- `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller` create Beans.
